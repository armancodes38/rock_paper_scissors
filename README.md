# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Overview

This is a simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game implemented in Python. The game allows the player to compete against the computer by choosing one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The game runs in the terminal and provides the results of each round, including the option to play again.

## How to Play

1. The game will ask you to input your choice: 
    - `r` for Rock
    - `p` for Paper

    - **Scissors beats Paper**
    - **Paper beats Rock**
    - If both player and computer choose the same, it is a draw.

4. After each round, you can choose to play again or exit the game.
